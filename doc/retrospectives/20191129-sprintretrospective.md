| Player Cue Interaction | Cue Shot Direction | Evaldas | 3 hours | 2.5 hours | Yes | Feature completed but not yet integrated in the game (as it depends on other features to be used) |
| Visual Display| Ball Movement | Luuk & Thomas | 5 hours  | 6 hours | Yes | Feature might need to be tweaked later to fit requirements for other tasks |
| Ball Interactions | Bounded borders for the board | Luuk & Thomas | 2 hours | 4 hours | Not yet | Feature is not fully done yet as right now the ball can still go out of bounds on the X and Z axis. |
| Ball Interactions | Ball and board collisions | Luuk & Thomas | 4 hours | 4 hours | Not yet | Same notes as bounded borders, once bounded borders is done this should be near completion as well.|
| Ball Interactions | Ball rolling friction |  Luuk & Thomas | 4 hours | 1 hour | No | Feature can be implemented using existing methods but it's currently unclear whether this is the best way.|
| Ball Types | Ball Types | Luuk | 3 hours | 1 hour | Yes/No | Ball type can be decided through id but subclasses could also be added for clarity.|

## Main Problems Encountered
### Problem 1: MoSCoW prioritization
#### Description
Estimation of MoSCoW tasks did not go well initially, resulting in Should Haves being tracked as Must Haves, and assigned to the Sprint.
In the middle of the Sprint, we had to swap some tasks around due to further prioritization issues. We realized some functional requirements
in our MoSCoW document had too high priorities (e.g. must have instead of should have), and thus we had to adjust.

#### Reaction
We have resolved this by re-prioritizing tasks and focusing mostly on the Must Haves in the project.

### Problem 2: Prioritizing Tasks
#### Description
At the beginning of the project, we did not properly prioritize tasks over others, and simply assigned the time estimates for the tasks without establishing
which tasks are the most important.

#### Reaction
After assigning tasks, we have discussed the priorities of each individual task, and have established these using Labels and the "Weight" functionality
in GitLab.

### Problem 3: No deadlines
#### Description
One crucial mistake that we did is not properly establish deadlines in the Sprint. This lead to quite a bit of procrastination and
overall a lack of focus through the Sprint.

#### Reaction
Some team members rushed delivery of the features at the end of the Sprint, and we started communicating far more often upon
realizing that tasks are due soon.

### Problem 4: Too many tasks
#### Description
Initially, before we could get a sense of the team's work & effort distribution, we planned too many tasks to be done for the Sprint.
Together with other issues (no deadlines, issues with prioritization), we could not carry out around 6 tasks in the Sprint.

#### Reaction
We have tried to as much as possible first to get the necessities done, and for the lower priority tasks that we could not
manage throughout the Sprint, we simply plan on putting off to the next one.


## Adjustments for next Sprint Plan
* Establish deadlines each week. As of now, we plan to establish strict deadlines to improve our planning and on-time delivery.
* Prioritize crucial features first. As of now, we will first prioritize only the Must Haves, then followed by the Should Haves, and we
will only take up Could Haves in the case that there is truly no more important work left, but the Sprint can still hold more stories & tasks.
* Establish clear weights and time estimates at the beginning of each Sprint. We now plan to discuss priorities more thoroughly, and verify
them when building the Sprint backlog.
* More thoroughly discuss on task assignment per person, and more carefully plan out the tasks so that we can ensure that most of them will be carried out. For the next Sprint,
* we will try to make the workload smaller and see how it works out (i.e. whether we did not underplan this)

## Main Problems Encountered
### Problem 1: MoSCoW prioritization
#### Description
Estimation of MoSCoW tasks did not go well initially, resulting in Should Haves being tracked as Must Haves, and assigned to the Sprint.
In the middle of the Sprint, we had to swap some tasks around due to further prioritization issues. We realized some functional requirements
in our MoSCoW document had too high priorities (e.g. must have instead of should have), and thus we had to adjust.

#### Reaction
We have resolved this by re-priotizing tasks and focusing mostly on the Must Haves in the project.

### Problem 2: Prioritizing Tasks
#### Description
At the beginning of the project, we did not properly prioritize tasks over others, and simply assigned the time estimates for the tasks without establishing
which tasks are the most important.

#### Reaction
After assigning tasks, we have discussed the priorities of each individual task, and have established these using Labels and the "Weight" functionality
in GitLab.

### Problem 3: No deadlines
#### Descrption
One crucial mistake that we did is not properly establish deadlines in the Sprint. This lead to quite a bit of procrastination and
overall a lack of focus through the Sprint.

#### Reaction
Some team members rushed delivery of the features at the end of the Sprint, and we started communicating far more often upon
realizing that tasks are due soon.


## Adjustments for next Sprint Plan
* Establish deadlines each week. As of now, we plan to establish strict deadlines to improve our planning and on-time delivery.
* Prioritize crucial features first. As of now, we will first prioritize only the Must Haves, then followed by the Should Haves, and we
will only take up Could Haves in the case that there is truly no more important work left, but the Sprint can still hold more stories & tasks.
* Establish clear weights and time estimates at the beginning of each Sprint. We now plan to discuss priorities more thoroughly, and verify
them when building the Sprint backlog.

## Main Problems Encountered
### Problem 1: Rescheduling of issues
#### Description
Due to the midterm week in between, we did not plan accordingly for the current Sprint. This resulted in good deadlines for the
first week, but for worse planning in the second week of the Sprint.

#### Reaction
After the midterm week, we rescheduled some deadlines, but this did not work as efficiently because our planning was still
somewhat off due to not allocatiing enough time for each issue.

### Problem 2: Workload estimation & distribution
#### Description
This week, the work distribution could have been far better. Due to priorities provided by our TA for tasks, two people (Luuk and Thomas) ended
up doing a large bulk of the main work for the Sprint initially. This lead to some imbalance due to priorities, even though the task
distribution was even.
This is more of an issue with estimation rather than distribution, which we could have put more thought into.

#### Reaction
To counteract the issue, the team started co-operating more, especially in the testing & bug fix regard. We debugged code together
to help solve blocking issues for the people that had the (noticably) highest workload.

### Problem 3: Underplanning of work
#### Description
Due to a few people (mainly Thomas & Luuk) running out of work to do, and no teammates expressing issues with regards to their own current work,
we had to move some more issues into the Sprint on the second week. This is mainly a result of a differing amount of work put into the project,
as not everyone took the time to fully complete their issues.
In the future, we should spread the work more evenly throughout the weeks, as this was the major issue why the problem occurred.

#### Reaction
During the Sprint, we did a re-estimation at the beginning of the second week, and decided which tasks would be important to do next.
Then, we assigned these tasks to the Sprint and documented on the reasoning why we did it.


## Adjustments for next Sprint Plan
* Work on workload distribution for each person more thoroughly; Based on past experiences, we should now have a good idea on
how long some tasks should take.
* Improve our backlog; In Sprint 1, we did not have a clear definition of tasks being done. In this Sprint, we started using checklists.
For the next one, we will aim to be more thorough with our subtasks.
* Try to distribute work more evenly. We could look at the total time for each week so that they are (at least roughly) equal in both weeks.
This time around, there was quite a bit of an imbalance.

## Adjustments from previous Sprint Plan
* We have successfully established deadlines this week, and tried to follow them. For the majority of the deadlines, they went well, but there were some issues due to the
midterm week in between
* This time around, we prioritized the must haves only from the issue board, which helped us focus on the core parts of the game more.
* At the beginning of the Sprint, we made clear estimations in terms of priority & time, as compared to the previous Sprint
* Our communication improved this Sprint, with more people getting involved in reviewsf and communicating issues they were encountering. This also meant more co-operation
between teammates

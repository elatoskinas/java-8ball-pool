## Main Problems Encountered

### Problem 1: Differing work output (first week)

#### Description
In the first week, we encountered issues that some team members put significantly more work than others, despite having assigned a workload of the same tasks.
This lead to an overall uneven contribution distribution.

#### Reaction
To address this, we would constantly ask team members (that were under-contributing) on status updates and alerted them to be aware of the deadlines, which,
in the end, mostly lead to their work being finished and the workload becoming more evened out.

### Problem 2: Postponing work

#### Description
During this Sprint, there were quite a bit of occurrences of work postponing to the point that a lot of work was finished only a few days before the deadline.
Unfortunately, the issue is hard to address due to differing levels of motivation & personal circumstances of individual team members.

#### Reaction
In the case of important features, we had other people step in to help with those features so that we could meet the deadlines and expectations, which turned out
quite well for our most high priority features.

### Problem 3: Emerging relatively high-priority bugs

#### Description
Throughout manual testing in between changes, it occurred that some bugs emerged that our automated test suite could not find. The bugs, in certain cases,
were relatively game breaking in certain scenarios and needed to be addressed.

#### Reaction
To address the bugs, we documented them and assigned people to fix them. Which ever person was free at the time to work on the high priority bugs would
focus on that instead of their own work for the time being (provided they did not have higher priority tasks). With this, we managed to resolve most
of the problems we found, while the unimportant ones were postponed for the future.

## Adjustments for the end of the Project & future Sprints
- Most importantly -- for future projects and Sprints, clear expectations should be set prior to the project and the Sprints.
One of the biggest issues we have are differing levels of motivation among the team members, and in projects such as these,
it is very important to establish on what everyone's work expectations are throughout the project, and how much they expect to achieve.
- Clear time estimates should be established based on everyone's personal circumstances. If someone had blocking issues in the previous
Sprints, their work should be assigned accordingly, and they should not take up much more work until they manage to fix the issue.
Hence, some re-estimation and re-distribution would be needed prior to each Sprint.
- Combining both of the above adjustments, and making sure everyone is on the same page on following the set deadlines (and ensuring
that everyone follows the same deadlines by constantly verifying the status of the issues that are due in the near future) would result
in solving the issue of postponing work.
- In the future, emerging bugs should be taken into account when estimating task workload. Hence, some amount of over-estimation could be
applied when more (and more complicated) features are being worked on than usual.

## Adjustments from previous Sprint Plan

- Save for exceptional cases where some people were not able to put in work due to their own personal circumstances, this Sprint
we seemed to distribute the workload evenly, with most people putting in similar amounts of work, not leading to any overshadowing
with regards to contribution count.

- We improved our backllog by properly defining & updating the subtasks, motivating prioritization for each task in the description,
and more explicitly documenting our choices made throughout the issues.

- This week, it seems that we did better with prioritization & time estimation in the sense that we spent some more time analyzing it and making changes
during the Sprint planning phase.
